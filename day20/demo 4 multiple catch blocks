//Checked exceptions

/*
 * these r checked by the compiler
 * u must handle them - using try - catch or we can declare throws(meaning we r redirecting the exception to the caller) 
 * usually for recoverable situation (like file not found or network issue)
 * 
 * */

//Unchecked exceptions

/*
* these r not checked by the compiler
* occurs due to code bug -- programming mistake  
* optional to handle

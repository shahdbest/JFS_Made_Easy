// when u have critical logic in ur application and u dont want someone to break that logic makes sure u mark u class as final .. marking the class as final ensures the calss can be used but cannot be modified

public final class Calculator {

 int add(int a,int b){
	 return a+b;
	 
	 
 }

 int sub(int a,int b){
	 return a-b;
